Pavement Overlay Design – Flexible Pavement

This project focuses on the overlay design of flexible pavements using traffic data, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values, and pavement crust details. The analysis evaluates both Left-Hand Side (LHS) and Right-Hand Side (RHS) road sections and provides the required overlay thickness based on IRC guidelines.

 Contents

Raw Data Sheets – Traffic data, pavement composition, and CBR values.

LHS Input & Output – Structural analysis for Left-Hand Side pavement.

RHS Input & Output – Structural analysis for Right-Hand Side pavement.

Analysis & Cumulative Approach – Traffic load assessment (msa) and overlay design calculations.



 Methodology

Collected traffic and pavement data.

Evaluated CBR values and existing pavement crust details.

Estimated cumulative traffic loading (msa) for design period.

Designed overlay thickness using IRC:37 guidelines.

Generated summary tables and recommendations.

 Key Highlights

Considered traffic loading scenarios (10–30 msa).

Separate analysis for LHS and RHS carriageway.

Final overlay thickness recommendations provided for extended service life.

Automated calculations in Excel for transparency and reproducibility.

 Tools & Skills Used

MS Excel (data processing & design calculations)

Highway & Pavement Engineering concepts

IRC:37 Guidelines for pavement design

CBR Method & Structural Overlay Analysis

 Outcomes

Determined the required overlay thickness for the project stretch.

Improved pavement serviceability and extended design life.

Demonstrated practical application of civil engineering design principles.
